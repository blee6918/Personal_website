# Brian (Minsoo) Lee - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and interests as a Data Science student and Machine Learning Engineer.

## Overview

This is a static, single-page application built to be fast, responsive, and visually engaging. It features a modern "Bento Grid" layout, glassmorphism effects, and an interactive dock-style navigation.
